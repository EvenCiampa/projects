We take the square root because N is the dimension of one side of a matrix so we want a number that when squared gives us the total.\n",

    "The Process Grid dimensions should take into account the total number of cores and aim to distribute work evenly while considering physical architecture (like NUMA nodes). For a total of $C$ cores, the goal is to find $P$ and $Q$ such that $P \\times Q = C$ and $|P - Q|$ is minimized. An initial approximation can be to set $P$ and $Q$ to the square root of $C$:\n",

    "- **$2 \\times \\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{C}}{2} \\rfloor$**: This calculation adjusts the initial estimate to ensure $P$ is an even number. We divide the initial estimate by $2$, round down to the nearest whole number (using the floor function, $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$), and then multiply by $2$ again. This gets you the nearest whole number.\n",

    "  - $Q$ is at least as large as $P$, maintaining an even distribution of tasks.\n",
    "  - If simply doubling $P$ does not cover all cores ($P \\times P < C$), $Q$ is incremented by $2$ (to the next even number) to help cover the shortfall.\n",
    "  - This adjustment maintains evenness and aims to utilize as many cores as possible without exceeding the total number of available cores. It also respects the preference for $P$ being smaller than $Q$ if they are not equal, which can be relevant for optimizing certain types of parallel computation that perform better with a \"taller\" rather than a \"wider\" grid.\n",
